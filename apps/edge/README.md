# aomi-edge

The Cloudflare Worker that is the public edge for every Aomi HTTP surface. It
replaces `product-mono/infra/cloudflare/worker` and, over the two cutovers in
the design doc, absorbs the proxy half of the Portal and Build BFFs.

One rule for every route: **the Worker owns the outside shape, the Rust
services own the inside shape.** Whatever a browser, CLI, MCP client or x402
venue sends, the Worker turns it into one typed call with a bearer it minted
as topology node `aomi-edge`. Rust never sees a venue header, a cookie or a
venue-specific URL.

## What is here now (cutover 1, step 1)

- `src/routing/*`: the routing core ported from product-mono: route allowlist,
  CORS profiles, rendezvous hashing over `BACKEND_ORIGINS`, tunnel failover,
  the hosted-app availability probe and the manager cutover switch.
- `src/task/*`: the Task API venue adapters.
  - A venue's `Authorization`, cookies and router headers never reach the API
    Server (`TASK_UPSTREAM_HEADERS`).
  - `GET`, `HEAD` and an empty `POST` on `/v1/task/build` answer the API
    Server's own body-bound 402 for its example request, cached within its
    validity window (`EDGE_CACHE` KV, in-isolate fallback).
  - A `text/plain` body that is JSON is relabelled `application/json`; the
    bytes are untouched so a `Payment-Signature` retry stays bound to them.
- `src/identity.ts`: the edge as an `AomiService` over
  `@aomi-labs/service-identity`, used by the proxies that follow.

## Running

The example below uses local backend bindings. `dev:staging` selects the
Wrangler environment; the copied variables still point at localhost.

```sh
pnpm --filter aomi-edge test        # vitest, no network
pnpm --filter aomi-edge typecheck
cp apps/edge/.dev.vars.example apps/edge/.dev.vars
pnpm --filter aomi-edge dev:staging
```

To test staging origins, use an ignored `apps/edge/.dev.vars.staging` with
the staging `BACKEND_ORIGINS`, `API_SERVER_ORIGIN`, `PAYMENT_ORIGIN`,
`EDGE_TOPOLOGY=staging` and the matching staging service private key. Obtain
origins from the staging inventory and credentials from its secret store.

Each hosted-app availability probe has a 1.5-second deadline. A timed-out
origin is unavailable for that attempt, so healthy pool members can serve
the request; configured warm-up retries retain their existing limit.

Discovery-cache follow-up: coalesce concurrent misses per origin within an
isolate, test that a burst creates one quote and that failure releases the
pending entry. Cache hits already reuse quotes, but concurrent misses and
different isolates can currently create extra quote rows. This is an
efficiency follow-up, not a payment execution path.

## Deploying

`scripts/deploy.mjs <staging|production>` runs `wrangler deploy` with
`BACKEND_ORIGINS`, `API_SERVER_ORIGIN` and `PAYMENT_ORIGIN` taken from the
deploy environment. product-mono's deploy pipeline derives those from its
Terraform inventory and exports them before calling this script. Secrets:
`EDGE_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY` (`pnpm --filter aomi-edge generate-key`).
